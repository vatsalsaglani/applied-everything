## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all
  overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals
  that cover all the intervals in the input.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example

Input
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Output:
[[1,6], [8,10], [15, 18]]

```

## How do we solve this?

Let's put the intervals `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]` on the number line.

Here, we can see interval `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` are overlapping and we can convert them to `[1, 6]`.

There are no other intervals which are overlapping.


Here, we aren't told to assume that the intervals are in sorted order. 
So the first thing we would be required to do is to sort the `intervals` list with the 0<sup>th</sup> of every interval in the list.

We initialize `output` list to store the new intervalse. We add the first interval from the `intervals` list to the `output` list.

We loop over the `intervals` list starting at index `1`. 

For any given interval at index `i` in the intervals list we check if the `start` of that interval is less than or equal to the `end` of the last interval in the `outputs` list. If this holds `True` we update the `end` of the last interval in the `outputs` list.

If the above condition doesn't hold `True` we have established for the interval at index `i` in the intervals list there is no overlap with the last interval in the `outputs` list. We can then just append the interval at index `i` in the interval list to the `outputs` list.


## Let's code it out

```dart:merge_intervals.py

def mergeIntervals(intervals):

    intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])

    outputs = [intervals[0]]

    for start, end in intervals[1:]:

        if start <= outputs[-1][1]:

            # overlap
            outputs[-1][1] = max(outputs[-1][1], end)
        
        else:

            outputs.append([start, end])
        
    return outputs

```
