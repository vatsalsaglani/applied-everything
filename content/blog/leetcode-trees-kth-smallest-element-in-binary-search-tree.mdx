## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth
  (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input:
root = [3, 1, 4, null, 2] 
k = 1
Output: 1
```

## How do we solve this?

As a condition for a tree to be reffered as a Binary Search Tree (BST) the value of the left subtree node must be less than the value of the root node and the value of the right node must be higher than the root node.

So we can start with the <b>in-order traversal</b> to traverse from `left - root- right`.

We move down the last left node in the left subtree

Add it to our current list and increase our counter `n` by `1` and check if `n == k`. If that condition satisfies we return the value of the node.

If not we move `current` to `current.right` and do the same process.

## Let's code it out

```dart:kth_smallest_bst.py

def kthSmallest(root, k):
    # iterative in-order traversal
    n = 0
    stack = []
    current = root

    while current or stack:

        while current:

            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
        
        current = stack.pop()

        n += 1
        
        if n == k:
        
            return current.val
        
        current = current.right

```
