## What's the question?

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Let's see an example

```dart:example
root = [2, 1, 3]

Output: True
```

## How do we solve this?

For a tree to be considered as a binary search tree (BST) the value of the left node must be less than the value of the root node and the value of the right node must be greater than the value of the root node.

So for every left subtree we need to check `-infinity < left.val < root.val` and for 
right subtree we need to check `root.val < right.val < infinity`. 

We need to travel to the end of the tree and if the node is `None` we will return `True`

## Let's code it out

```dart:valid_bst.py

def isValidBST(root):

    def validate(node, left, right):

        if not node: return True

        if not (node.val < right and node.val > left): return False

        return (validate(node.left, left, node.val) and validate(node.right, node.val, right))

    return validate(root, float("-inf"), float("inf"))

```
