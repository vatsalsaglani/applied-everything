## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should
  be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
</blockquote>

### Let's look at an example

```dart:example
l1 = [1, 2, 4]
l2 = [3, 4]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```


## How do we solve this?

We will traverse the lists at the same time and create a `dummy` and keep on adding pointer reference to the dummy node as we travel through both the lists based on the values of the nodes.

Let's see it here,

## Let's code it out

```dart:mergeTwoLists.py
def mergeTwoLists(l1, l2):

    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy

    while l1 and l2:

        if l1.val < l2.val:
            tail.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            tail.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        tail = tail.next
    
    if l1:
        tail.next = l1
    elif l2:
        tail.next = l2
    
    return dummy.next
```
