## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false
  otherwise.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
Output
True
```

## How do we solve this?

For two strings to be anagrams of each other all the characters used in the first string should be used in the another string same number of times.

We will count the number of characters used in both the strings if they are same we return `True` else we return `False`


## Let's code it out

```dart:anagram.py

from collections import defaultdict

def isAnagram(s, t):

    start, target = defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int)

    for c in s:
        start[c] += 1
    
    for c in t:
        target[c] += 1
    
    return True if start == target else False

```
