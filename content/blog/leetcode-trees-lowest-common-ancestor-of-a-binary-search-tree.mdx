## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two
  given nodes in the BST.
</blockquote>

### What is LCA?
<blockquote>
  According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
  is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
  and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
</blockquote>


## How do we solve this?

As we know that the node in the left of root is has lower value than the root node and node in the right has a value higher than the root node.

We are already given two variable `p` and `q` for which we need to find the LCA. 

For example our root node is `10` and the `p` and `q` are `2` and `6` respectively then we just need to traverse the left sub tree and get the LCA for the given `p` and `q`.

Now suppose the value of the root node remains same but, `p` is changed to `12` and `q` is changed to `14`. Now we can see both the values are higher than the root node value and we need to find the LCS in the right subtree.

If these two conditions don't hold true than we say that we have reached the leaf nodes and the current root is the least common ancestor.

One more thing which can hold true is out of `p` and `q` one is the root itself and according to the defination of LCA a root can be a descendant of itself.

## Let's code it out

```dart:lowest_common_ancestor.py

def lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q):

    if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
    elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    else:
        return root

```
