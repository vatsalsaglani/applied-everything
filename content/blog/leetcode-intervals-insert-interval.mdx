## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the
  intervals (merge if necessary). You may assume that the intervals were
  initially sorted according to their start times.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input
intervals = [[1, 3], [6, 9]]
newInterval = [2, 5]
Output
[[1, 5], [6, 9]]
```

## How do we solve this?

Let's put the intervals `[[1, 3], [6, 9]]` and newInterval `[2, 5]` on the number line and see how it all looks.

We can see intervals `[1, 3]` and `[2, 5]` are overlapping and a new interval `[1, 5]` can replace them entirely.

To do this in code, we can loop over the `intervals` list and check for if the `start` of interval at `ix` is in the intervals list is less than or equal to the `start` of the `newInterval`. If this condition is `True` than we just append the `interval` at index `ix` in the `intervals` list to the `newIntervals` list.

If that's not the case than we know there is an overlap somewhere. So we take the `end` of the last interval in the `intervals` list and update it with end of the `newInterval` i.e. `newEnd` like this `max(end, newEnd)`.

After doing this we will still have few intervals left in the `intervals` list which might be greater than the `newInterval`.

So, we will loop over the remaining intervals and see their `start` and `end`. If the `start` is greater than the end of the last element in the `newIntervals` list we know there is no overlap and we can append the `[start, end]` to the `newIntervals` list.

If the above condition doesn't hold we can need to update the end of the last interval in the `newIntervals` list like we did before.

## Let's code it out

```dart:insert_interval.py

def insert(intervals, newIntervals):

    if not intervals:

        return [newInterval]
    
    newIntervals = []
    newStart, newEnd = newInterval

    loopN = len(intervals)
    ix = 0

    # adding original till newStart starts overlapping
    while ix < loopN and intervals[ix][0] <= newStart:

        newIntervals.append(intervals[ix])

        ix += 1
    
    
    # append or update interval with the new interval
    if not newIntervals:
        newIntervals.append(newInterval)
    elif newIntervals[-1][1] < newStart:
        # no overlap
        newIntervals.append(newInterval)
    else:
        #  overlap
        newIntervals[-1][1] = max(newIntervals[-1][1], newEnd)
    
    
    # append or update remaining intervals
    while ix < loopN:

        newStart, newEnd = intervals[ix]

        if newIntervals[-1][1] < newStart:
            # no overlap
            newIntervals.append([newStart, newEnd])
        else:
            # overlap
            newIntervals[-1][1] = max(newIntervals[-1][1], maxEnd)
        
        ix += 1
    
    return newIntervals

```
