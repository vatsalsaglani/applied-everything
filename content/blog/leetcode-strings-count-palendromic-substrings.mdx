## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string
  is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. A substring is a
  contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input
s = "abc"
Output
3 ("a", "b", "c")
```

## How do we solve this?

We can use the two pointer approach or the sliding window approach whatever you want to call it to solve this problem. 

We can loop over every character in the string and keep on checking it's left and right characters and if they are equal we increase the count.

Let's say we are given the string <b>`bab`</b>. We need to find the number of palindromic substrings for this string. We loop over the string and start our first iteration.

## Let's code it out

```dart:count_substrings.py

def countSubstrings(s):

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):

        # odd length strings
        # ex. bab

        l, r, = i, i

        while 0 <= l < len(s) and 0 <= r < len(r) and s[l] == s[r]:
            count += 1
            l -= 1
            r += 1
        
        # even length strings
        # ex. baab
        
        l, r = i, i+1
        
        while 0 <= l < len(s) and 0 <= r < len(r) and s[l] == s[r]:
            count += 1
            l -= 1
            r += 1
    
    return count

```
