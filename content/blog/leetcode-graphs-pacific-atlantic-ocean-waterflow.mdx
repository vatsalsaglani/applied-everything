## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  You are given an m x n integer matrix heights representing the height of each
  unit cell in a continent. The Pacific ocean touches the continent's left and
  top edges, and the Atlantic ocean touches the continent's right and bottom
  edges. Water can only flow in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
  Water flows from a cell to an adjacent one with an equal or lower height.
  Return a list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and
  Atlantic oceans.
</blockquote>

### Let's look at an example

For example we are given the following cell unit heights:

For every unit cell let's see if the water can flow from it

#### From `2`

From `2` the water can only flow to the unit cell with height `1`.

#### From `1`

From `1` the water cannot flow to any of the three cells as the height of 1 is less than the height of all the other cells

#### From `3`

From `3` the water can only flow to the unit cell with height `2`.

#### From `5`

From `5` the water can flow to unit cells with height `1` and `3`.

*Looking at all the images from above we can say the the unit cell with height `1` has water flowing from both the <b>Pacific</b> and the <b>Atlantic</b> ocean via unit cell with height `2` and unit cell with height `5` respectivel.*

## How do we solve this problem?

Instead of directly finding the coordinates where the water flows from both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean we can have two sets for Pacific and Atlantic ocean which has coordinates where the water flows from either of them. 

Now we would just to find the coordinates which are present in both the sets because those coordinates will have water flowing from both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean

### Let's code this one out


```dart:pacific_atlantic_waterflow.py

def pacific_atlantic_waterflow(heights):

    M, N = len(heights), len(heights[0])

    ## lists to store pacific and atlantic coordinates
    pacific, atlantic = [], []

    ## sets to store coordinates where the water flows from either of them
    visited_pacific, visited_atlantic = set(), set()

    ## initialize coordinates for pacific part and atlantic part
    for r in range(M):
        # left 
        pacific.append((r, 0))
        # right 
        atlantic.append((r, N - 1))

    for c in range(N):
        # top
        pacific.append((0, c))
        # bottom
        atlantic.append((M-1, c))

    ## direction of water flow left, right, top, bottom
    directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]

    def dfs(r, c, visited):

        # start coordinates water will flow
        visited.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in directions:
            row, col = dr + r, dc + c
            if (
                # row in bounds of M
                row in range(M)
                and
                # column in bounds of N
                col in range(N)
                and
                # water flow condition higher level to lower level
                heights[r][c] <= heights[row][col]
                and
                # not already visited
                (row, col) not in visited
            ):
                # recursion for going inside the grid
                dfs(row, col, visited)
    

    for r, c in pacific: dfs(r, c, visited_pacific)
    for r, c in atlantic: dfs(r, c, visited_atlantic)

    return visited_pacific & visited_atlantic
```
