## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder
  traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same
  tree, construct and return the binary tree.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
preorder = [3, 9, 20, 15, 7]
inorder = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7]

Tree:

[3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]
```

## How do we solve this?

Let's see what's the direction of in-order and pre-order traversals.

<b>In-order</b> traversal is from <b><i>LEFT ➡️ ROOT ➡️ RIGHT</i></b>

<b>Pre-order</b> traversal is from <b><i>ROOT ➡️ LEFT ➡️ RIGHT</i></b>

The first element in the <i>pre-order</i> traversal list will be the root of the <b>tree</b>

We can find the index of the the root we obtained from the <i>pre-order</i> traversal list i.e. `3` in the <i>in-order</i> traversal list and get the left and right nodes from it.
Elements on the left of the root node in the <i>in-order</i> traversal list will be in the left subtree and elements on the right of the root node will be in the right subtree.

We have only one element in the left i.e. `9`. So our root and left subtree will look something like this.

We have nodes 20, 15, and 7 remaining in the right subtree. But we don't know which is the root node of the right subtree out of them.

So again we go to our <i>pre-order</i> traversal and ignore the elements `3` and `9` and check the rest and we will see `20` is the first node and it will be our root node for the right subtree.

Now to get the left and right child of the node `20` we need to check the <i>in-order</i> traversal list and don't forget to ignore the elements `3` and `9`. 

Once we find the index of `20` in the remaining elements we will notice that `15` is on the left and `7` is on the right.

Now let's complete our incomplete tree

You guessed it right, we will be using recursion here also to recursively find the left and right child of every subtree and root node.

## Let's code this out

```dart:build_tree.py

def buildTree(preorder, inorder):

    if not inorder or not preorder:
        return None
    
    root = TreeNode(preorder[0])

    mid = inorder.index(preorder[0])

    root.left = buildTree(preorder[1:mid+1], inorder[:mid])
    root.right = buildTree(preorder[mid+1:], inorder[mid+1:])

    return root

```
