## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list
  and return its head.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input:
head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; n = 2
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 5]
```

## How do we solve this?

We can use a <b>two pointer</b> approach to solve this problem. 

We can initialize a `dummy` node point `left` pointer to it. We can point point the `right` pointer to the `head` node.

Until `n` is `0` we keep on moving the `right` pointer to the next node.

Once `n` is `0` we move to the `left` pointer and `right` pointer to next nodes until `right` is not `None`

Once `right` becomes `None` we will notice that our `left` pointer will be at a node whose neighbour is the `n`<sup>th</sup> from the end.

What do we do? We change the refrence pointer of the left to the refrence pointer of next of next i.e. the next node's neighbour.

## Let's code it out

```dart:removeNthNodeFromEnd.py

def removeNthNodeFromEnd(head, n):

    dummy = ListNode()
    left = dummy
    right = head

    while > 0:
        right = right.next 
        n -= 1
    
    while right:
        left = left.next
        right = right.next
    
    left.next = left.next.next

    return dummy.next
```

And that's it ðŸ˜…
