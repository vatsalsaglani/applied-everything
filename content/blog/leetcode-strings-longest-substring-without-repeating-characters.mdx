## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
  characters.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input
s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
```

## How do we solve this?

Like every other string problem we use the sliding window approach and by initializing the `left_ptr` as `0` and go over the string with `right_ptr` as index of the loop. We add the character to a `set` and if we find a character being repeated we start removing characters from the left and shrink the window by increasing the `left_ptr`.

After every iteration we update the `result` variable with `max(result, right_ptr - left_ptr + 1)`. 

Our motive for the sliding window is to not have any repeating characters in our window. If we find any repeating characters we start shrinking our window by moving the `left_ptr` towards the right.

*Let's see it in an example*

We have the string <b>`abca`</b> and we need to find the longest non repeating substring

## Let's code it out

```dart:length_of_longest_substring.py

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):

    characterSet = set()
    result = 0
    left_ptr = 0

    for right_ptr in range(len(s)):

        while s[right_ptr] in characterSet:

            # shrink window size by deleting from left

            characterSet.remove(s[left_ptr])
            left_ptr += 1
        
        characterSet.add(s[right_ptr])

        result = max(result, right_ptr - left_ptr + 1)
    
    return result

```
