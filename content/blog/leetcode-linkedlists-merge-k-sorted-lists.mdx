## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in
  ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and
  return it.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
lists = [[1, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4], [2, 6]]
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

## How do we solve this?

This problem is somewhat similar to the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/leetcode-linkedlists-merge-2-sorted-lists">Merge 2 Sorted Lists</a> problem that we discussed earlier. If you haven't gone through that problem, I highly advice you to do so.

Let's assume that we are given these three lists inside our `list` variable

We loop through this list and take two lists at a time and pass it to our `mergeTwoLists` function and get a sorted lists with nodes occuring in both the lists.

We add this merged list to a `mergedLists` variable

Now we take the remaining list i.e.`[2, 6]` in the `lists` variable and we don't have any other list after that so for the second list we take `None` and pass `[2, 6], None` to our `mergeTwoLists` function and we will get `[2, 6]` as the output and append it to the `mergedLists` variable.

The `mergedLists` variable will be like this

We replace the `lists` variable with the `mergedLists` variable and then again loop over the `lists` variable and take the two remaining lists and pass it to the `mergeTwoLists` function and get one sorted list.

We add that list to the `mergedLists` variable and then replace the `lists` variable with the `mergedLists` variable and at the end we will have only one list inside our `lists` variable and we will return `lists[0]`.

The last list inside the `lists` variable will be

## Let's code it out

```dart:mergeKLists.py

def mergeTwoLists(l1, l2):

    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy

    while l1 and l2:

        if l1.val < l2.val:
            tail.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            tail.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        tail = tail.next
    
    if l1:
        tail.next = l1
    elif l2:
        tail.next = l2
    
    return dummy.next


def mergeKLists(lists):

    if not lists or len(lists) == 0:
        return None
    
    while len(lists) > 1:

        mergedLists = []
        for i in range(0, len(lists), 2):
            l1 = lists[i]
            l2 = lists[i + 1] if i + 1 < len(lists) else None
            mergedLists.append(mergeTwoLists(l1, l2))
        lists = mergedLists
    
    return lists[0]
```

And we are done ðŸ˜….
