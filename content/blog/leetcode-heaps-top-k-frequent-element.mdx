## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent
  elements. You may return the answer in any order.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
k = 2

Output: [1, 2]
```

## How do we solve this?

We count the occurrences of every number using a `Counter` in python. 

We then convert the keys and values of the `Counter` (`dictionary`) into a list of `tuples`. 

We will be using `heapq` in python and it support `min-heap` only. So when we convert the `Counter` to list of `tuples` we will add a `negative` sign to to occurrences value for every number so when they get sorted by minimum value when we heapify them we can just take the first `k` numbers and return


## Let's code it out

```dart:top_k_frequent_elements.py

import heapq
from collections import Counter

def topKFrequent(numbers, k):

    c = Counter(numbers)
    c = [(-v, k) for k, v in c.items()]
    heapq.heapify(c)
    output = []
    for i in range(k):

        item = heapq.heappop(c)
        output.append(item)
    
    return output
```
