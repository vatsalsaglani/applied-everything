## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example

Input
s = "babad"
Output
"bab" or "abd"

```

## How do we solve this?

This question is similar to the <a target="_blank" href="/blog/leetcode-strings-count-palendromic-substrings">Count Palindromic Substrings</a> question. In that question we have to keep a count of the palindromic substrings which can be formed from the given string.

Here, we need to store the max length palindromic substring which can be formed from the given string to return it.

So the `count` variable will be replaced by two variables `res` to store the max length substring and `resLen` to store the max lenght of the current palindromic substring. Using `resLen` we will compare the substring length while looping over the given string.

If the current lenght of the substring is higher than the `resLen` we will update our `resLen` and also update our `res`.



## Let's code it out

```dart:longest_palindrome.py

def longestPalindrome(s):

    res, resLen = "", 0

    for i in range(len(s)):


        # odd length Substrings
        # eg. "bab"
        l, r = i, i

        while 0 <= l < len(s) and 0 <= r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:

            if (r - l + 1) > resLen:

                res = s[l:r+1]
                resLen = r - l + 1
            
            l -= 1
            r += 1
        

        # even length substrings
        # eg. "baab"

        l, r = i, i + 1

        while 0 <= l < len(s) and 0 <= r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:

            if (r - l + 1) > resLen:

                res = s[l:r+1]
                resLen = r - l + 1
            
            l -= 1
            r += 1

    return res

```
