## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
  sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
  transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
  same or another computer environment.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
  restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
  You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
  this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

For the sake of seeing an example I will the put it below but whatever input tree is given we have to encode it into some format and store it and then write a decoder function to decode it to get back the same tree.

```dart:example
Input:
root = [1, 2, 3, null, null, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, null, null, 4, 5]
```

Yes, I copied the input and pasted it as the output but that's what we need to do. Not copy-paste!

## How do we solve this problem?

#### Serialization:

Let's start with a serialization strategy. We can traverse the tree in a <b>level-order</b> fashion i.e. `root-left-right`.
We put the values of the nodes in the path to a list and join the list with `,`. We can store this string seperated by `,`.

#### Deserialization:

To decode/deserialize the traversal string seperated by `,`, we will first split it by `,` and then take the very first value in the list of seperated characters as the `root` node becuse we know that in <i>level-order</i> traversal the first node is alway the root node.

As we have the `root` node in our queue we will start moving `left` and `right`. We will initialize a index variable `i` to get values from the split character list. As we add the character at index `i` from the list to the tree we will increase the value of `i`. We also add the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> node to the queue as well.

Once the queue is empty we return the root node.

## Let's code it out

```dart:encode_decode_tree.py

def serialize(root):

    # level order traversal

    flat_bt = []
    queue = []
    queue.append(root)

    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node:
            flat_bt.append(str(node.val))
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
        else:
            flat_bt.append('')

    return ",".join(flat_bt)

def deserialize(data):

    if not data:
        return

    flat_bt = data.split(',')
    root = TreeNode(flat_bt[0])
    queue = []
    queue.append(root)
    i = 1
    while queue:

        node = queue.pop(0)

        if i < len(flat_bt) and flat_bt[i]:
            node.left = TreeNode(int(flat_bt[i]))
            queue.append(node.left)
        i += 1
        if i < len(flat_bt) and flat_bt[i]:
            node.right = TreeNode(int(flat_bt[i]))
            queue.append(node.right)
        i += 1

    return root

```
