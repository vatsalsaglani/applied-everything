## What actually is a Linked List?

In short, a Linked List is a linear data structure similar to an array but it doesn't utilize contiguous data blocks in the memory like arrays or lists does.

We will come to the memory part at a later stage in this blog but before that let's see how's a Linked List made.

### Parts of a Linked List

A Linked List is made up of series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.

The starting point in a linked list is a reference to the first node, and is reffered as the `Head` node.

The end of a linked list is not a node but rather a node that points to `NULL`, or empty list.

Let's see it in an image

A <b>node</b> in a linked list only knows about the data it contains and a reference to it's <b>neighbor</b>.

## How's a Linked List different than an Array or a List in Python?

The first difference between a linked list and an array/list is the way they are constructed.
As mentioned above, linked list is bacially a collection of nodes and a head which has a reference to the first node.

In Arrays/Lists there is no concept of head nodes.

One more main difference is how each data structure utilizes the memory. In case of arrays/lists when initializing those it use a contiguous block of memory.
Now you might as what does that mean?

Let's say this is our memory at start

After initializing a list/array

No matter the size of the list/array a default block of memory will be initialize and then elements will be filled. In programming languages like Python and Javascript we don't see this allocation or don't need to manually do this allocation because it's hidden behind layers and layers of abstraction.

No assume we want to copy this array/list into another variable; it will again take one more big block of memory and copy things so there is a lot of memory usage in case of lists/array.

_So, how does a linked list help?_

In case of linked list, the nodes can be at any place in the memory as every node has the data and info about it's neighbour node we can still traverse all the nodes when needed.
This is how the memory looks like when we have a linked list with 6 nodes.

Now let's say we want to <i>copy this linked list into a new one</i>. We just need to initialize the `head` node and provide a reference to the first node and traverse the previous list and keep on adding the neighbors to the new list and we are done.

Linked Lists are more memory efficient but, they have their own drawbacks. Let's say we want to delete the last node in the linked list we would need to travel to the end and delete it and if there are a lot of elements it will take a lot of time.

Enough of theory let's code some Linked Lists ⌨️

## Linked Lists in Python

### How to initialize the Linked List data structure in Python?

```dart:linked_list_node
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, neighbors = None):

        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors
```

### How to traverse a Linked List in Python?

```dart:linked_list_traverse
## linked list data structure from above
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, neighbors = None):

        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors

## linked list traversal and out functionalities

class LinkedList:

    def __init__(self):
        self.headval = None
    
    def listprint(self):
        linked_list = self.headval
        while linked_list:
            print(linked_list.val)
            # move to next node
            linked_list = linked_list.next
```

*Executing the `LinkedList` object*

```dart:execute_linked_list
# initialize empty linked list
list1 = LinkedList()
# add first node reference to headval
list1.headval = Node("MON")
n2 = Node("TUE")
n3 = Node("WED")

# next of headval
list1.headval.next = n2
# next of n2
n2.next = n3

## printing the linked list
list1.listprint()
>>> MON
    TUE
    WED
```

### How to add a node at the beginning in a linked list using Python?

```dart:add_node_at_start
class LinkedList:

    def __init__(self):
        self.headval = None
    
    def listprint(self):
        linked_list = self.headval
        while linked_list:
            print(linked_list.val)
            # move to next node
            linked_list = linked_list.next
    
    def addAtBeginning(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        node.next = self.headval
        self.headval = node

## try it out
l = LinkedList()
l.headval = Node("MON")
n2 = Node("TUE")
n3 = Node("WED")

l.headval.next = n2
n2.next = n3

l.addAtBeginning("SUN")

l.listprint()
>>> SUN
    MON
    TUE
    WED
```

### How to insert a node at the end in a linked list using Python?

```dart:add_node_at_end

class LinkedList:

    def __init__(self):
        self.headval = None
    
    def listprint(self):
        linked_list = self.headval
        while linked_list:
            print(linked_list.val)
            # move to next node
            linked_list = linked_list.next
    
    def addAtBeginning(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        node.next = self.headval
        self.headval = node
    
    def addAtEnd(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        if self.headval is None:
            self.headval = node
            return
        
        last = self.headval
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = node

## try it out
l = LinkedList()
l.headval = Node("MON")
n2 = Node("TUE")
n3 = Node("WED")

l.headval.next = n2
n2.next = n3

l.atBeginning("SUN")
l.atEnd("THU")
>>> SUN
    MON
    TUE
    WED
    THU
```

### How to insert a node in between two node in a Linked List using Python?

```dart:insert_in_between
class LinkedList:

    def __init__(self):
        self.headval = None
    
    def listprint(self):
        linked_list = self.headval
        while linked_list:
            print(linked_list.val)
            # move to next node
            linked_list = linked_list.next
    
    def addAtBeginning(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        node.next = self.headval
        self.headval = node
    
    def addAtEnd(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        if self.headval is None:
            self.headval = node
            return
        
        last = self.headval
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = node
    
    def addInBetween(self, middle_node, data):
        node = Node(data)
        if middle_node is None:
            return "Node mentioned is absent"
        
        node.next = middle_node.next
        middle_node.next = node

# try it out

l = LinkedList()
l.headval = Node("MON")
n2 = Node("TUE")
n3 = Node("THU")

l.headval.next = n2
n2.next = n3

l.inBetween(l.headval.next, "WED")
>>> MON
    TUE
    WED
    THU
```

### How to remove a node in a linked list using Python?

```dart:remove_node
class LinkedList:

    def __init__(self):
        self.headval = None
    
    def listprint(self):
        linked_list = self.headval
        while linked_list:
            print(linked_list.val)
            # move to next node
            linked_list = linked_list.next
    
    def addAtBeginning(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        node.next = self.headval
        self.headval = node
    
    def addAtEnd(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        if self.headval is None:
            self.headval = node
            return
        
        last = self.headval
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = node
    
    def addInBetween(self, middle_node, data):
        node = Node(data)
        if middle_node is None:
            return "Node mentioned is absent"
        
        node.next = middle_node.next
        middle_node.next = node
    
    def removeNode(self, removekey):
        headval = self.headval
        ## if first node
        if headval:
            if headval.val == removekey:
                self.headval = headval.next
                headval = None
                return
        
        while headval:
            if headval.val == removekey:
                break
            prev = headval
            headval = headval.next
        
        if not headval:
            return
        
        prev.next = headval.next

        headval = None

## try it out

l = LinkedList()
l.atBeginning("MON")
l.atBeginning("TUE")
l.atBeginning("WED")
l.atBeginning("THU")
l.atBeginning("FRI")
l.listprint()

>>> FRI
    THU
    WED
    TUE
    MON

l.removeNode("TUE")
l.listprint()
>>> FRI
    THU
    WED
    MON
```
