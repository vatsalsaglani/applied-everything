## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{", "}', '[' and
  ']', determine if the input string is valid.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

The opening and closing brackets must be same and brackets must be closed in the same order

```dart:example
s = "()"
True

s = "()[}]"
False
```


## How do we solve this?

We can have a bracket mapping dictionary to map opening and closing brackets.

As we move along the string we can push the bracket to the stack if it's an opening bracket.

Else if we encounter a closing bracket we check if the stack for it's opening pair at the top of the stack and if it's there we move one or else we return a `False`

## Let's code it out

```dart:valid_parentheses.py

def isValid(s):

    bracketMapping = {
        "{": "}",
        "(": ")",
        "[": "]",
    }

    bracketStack = []

    for bracket in s:

        if bracket in bracketMapping:

            bracketStack.append(bracket)

        else:

            if not bracketStack or bracketMapping[bracketStack.pop()] == bracket:
                return False
    
    return len(bracketStack) == 0

```
