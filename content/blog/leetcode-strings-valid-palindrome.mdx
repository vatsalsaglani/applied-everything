## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only
  alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input
s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output
True
```


## How do we solve this?

For a string to be a palindrome the reverse of the string must be the same string i.e. `aba` is a palindrome because the reverse is also `aba`.

It's the same thing her we don't need to consider spaces and special characters while checking if a string is a palindrome or not.


## Let's code it out

```dart:palindrome.py

def isPalindrome(s):

    s = [c for c in s.lower() if c.isalnum()]

    return True if s == s[::-1] else False

```
