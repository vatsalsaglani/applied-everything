## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they
  are the same or not.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical,
  and the nodes have the same value.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input:
p = [1, 2, 3]
q = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 
True
```

## How do we solve this?

As mentioned in the question for two trees to be same they must be structurally identically and the values in the nodes must be same. 

So the codition is <i>value of p equal to value of q and left subtree of p equal to left subtree of q and right subtree of p equal to right subtree of q</i>

So what are our base cases.

1. If there is no `p` and no `q` we say `None` = `None` i.e. `True`.
2. If `p` is there and `q` is not there or vice verca it will be obviously `False`.

We can recursively check this by applying the conditions to the root node and the left subtree and right subtree recursively.

## Let's code it out

```dart:same_tree.py

def sameTree(p, q):

    if not p and not q:
        return True
    elif not p or not q:
        return False
    else:
        return p.val == q.val and sameTree(p.left, q.left) and sameTree(p.right, q.right)

```
