## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi],
  return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of
  the intervals non-overlapping.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example

Input
intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output = 1

```


## How do we solve this?

Let's put the intervals `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]` on the number line

Here, `[1, 2]` and `[1, 3]` are overlapping.

We can remove `[1, 3]` because `1` is covered in `[1,2]` and `3` is covered in both `[2, 3]` and `[3, 4]`.

In the example the intervals aren't sorted. We need to sort them but how dow we sort them?

Let's say the `intervals` list has `[[0, 2], [0. 1]]` as intervals. The <b>left</b> of both the intervals is same i.e. `0`. But the <b>right</b> is different. 

We know that `[0, 1]` get's covered in `[0, 2]`, so we just need to delete `[0, 1]`. So if we have a sorted intervals list by the `end` of interval we can easily finish the problem in a single loop.

We initialize a variable `previousEnd` to store what our `end` value was previously. If the for current interval at index `i` we have a `start` and an `end` value we can check if the `start` is greater than or equal to the `previousEnd` there is no overlap between the current interval and interval that was there previously. We can replace the `previousEnd` with the current `end`.

If the condition above doesn't hold then we know there is an overlap and as we have sorted the intervals by the `end` key we know that we can delete/erase the current interval so we increase the delete/remove count.


## Let's code it out

```dart:non_overlapping_intervals.py

def deleteOverlappingIntervals(intervals:

    if not intervals: return 0

    intervals.sort(key: lambda x: x[1])
    previousEnd, count = float("-inf"), 0

    for start, end in intervals:

        if start >= previousEnd:
            # no overlap
            previousEnd = end
        else:
            # overlap
            count += 1
    
    return count

```
