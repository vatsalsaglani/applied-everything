## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path
  from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
</blockquote>

### Let's look at an example

We are given the following tree we need to find the Maximum depth for this binary tree

Here, the longest path from root to the farthest leaf node has `4` nodes therefore, the maximum depth will be `4`.

## How do we solve this?

Like every other tree problem here also we will use the <b>recursion</b>. 

Let's see how it will work in few steps.

For the tree given below let's recursively find the `maxDepth`.

To get the maximum depth of the tree from the root node we need to know the maximum depth of the left and right subtree and their left and right subtrees.

So let's see what for what all subtree we need the max depth to reach at the max depth from the root

We need to find the max depth of three subtree, one on the left and two on the right.

*So let's start with the one on the left (PART LEFT A)*

There are no nodes after `4` and `5` in the left subtree. So we can say the node after `4` and `5` are `None` and if a node is `None` than the max depth becomes `0` because there is no node at all.

So the max depth of `4` will be `max(0, 0) + 1` and max depth of `5` will be `max(0, 0) + 1`. 

Now we have the max depth of `4` and `5` we can move upwards and get the max depth of `2` i.e. `max(1, 1) + 1 = 2`. And we have the max depth of the whole left subtree

*Let's move to the right sub tree (PART RIGHT - B)*

Like nodes `4` and `5` the nodes `8` and `9` don't have any child nodes so we get max depth of `1` at both `8` and `9`. 

To calculate the max depth at `7` we can do `max(1, 1) + 1 = 2` and the max depth at `7` will be `2`. 

*Let's move to the PART RIGHT - A*

Like nodes `4`, `5`, `8`, and `9` node `6` also doesn't have any left or right children so the max depth at `6` will be `1`. 

We calcualted the max depth of `7` in our previous step and it is `2`

Now we can calculate the max depth of node `3` i.e. `max(1, 2) + 1 = 3`.

Now we have max depth of the left and right subtree of the root node. Now we can calculate the max depth of the root node.

To get the max depth of the root node we just have to use `max(2, 3) + 1 = 4`. So the max depth of the given binary tree is `4`.


## Let's code out a solution

```dart:max_depth.py

def maxDepth(root):

    if not root:
        return 0
    
    left_depth = maxDepth(root.left)
    right_depth = maxDepth(root.right)

    return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1

```

Apply this `maxDepth` function to the `root` node and you are done. Yeah in just <b>6</b> lines.
