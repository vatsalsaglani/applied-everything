## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return
  the answer in any order.
</blockquote>


### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input:
strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output:
[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```


## How do we solve this?

We loop through every string in the list and sort it i.e. `eat` becomes `aet` and also `ate` becomes `aet`. 

We create a dictionary and add the current string to the sorted key and at the end we return all the values of the dictionary.

## Let's code it out

```dart:group_anagrams.py

from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):

    groups = defaultdict(list)

    for st in strs:

        # get the key anagram after sorting
        # eg. sorted("eat") = "aet"
        #     sorted("tea") = "aet" 
        # for bot `aet` is the key

        s = "".join(sorted(st))
        groups[s].append(st)
    
    return [v for v in groups.values()]


```
