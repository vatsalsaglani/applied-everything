## What's the question?

<blockquote>
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
</blockquote>

### Let's look at an example

```dart:example
Inputs
numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0]]

Output: True
```

In the given example if we create an adjacency list of the pre-requisites it will look something like following
```dart:adjacency_list
adjacency_list = {
    1: [0],
    0: []
}
```
In this case the prerequisites for `1` is `0` and there aren't any prerequisites to complete zero. So if we take `0` and then we take `1` we can finish the courses

*Now, let's look at one more example*

```dart:example_2
Input
numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

Ouput: False
```

In case of this example we can make an adjacency list as follows:

```dart:adjacency_list
adjacency_list = {
    1: [0],
    0: [1]
}
```

From above you might have noticed that, to complete course `1` we need to complete course `0` and to complete course `0` we need to complete course `1`. This sets the deadlock stage or make a cycle and we return `False`.

## Let's code it

Using the prerequisites we make an adjacency list for the graph representation. We recursively travel the graph for every course and check if the prerequisites of that course is already visited and if so we return `False` and if there aren't any prerequisites for a particular course we return `True`. 

```dart:course_schedule.py

def canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites):

    requirementsMap = {i:[] for i in range(numCourses)}

    for course, req in prerequisites:
        requirementsMap[course].append(req)
    
    visitset = set()

    def dfs(course):

        if requirementsMap[course] == []: return True

        if course in visitset:
            return False
        
        for reqs in requirementsMap[course]:

            if not dfs(reqs):
                return False
        
        # remove course from visit list if no cycle encountered for the prerequisites
        visitset.remove(course)
        # map the requirements for that course to empty list depecting satisfied prerequisites
        requirementsMap[course] = []
        # return with True for that course
        return True
    
    for course in range(numCourses):
        
        if not dfs(course):
            return False
    
    return True
```

Like all other graph based questions on Leetcode this question also uses recursion. It's not that intuitive, if done multiple times it's easy to understand.
