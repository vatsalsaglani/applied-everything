## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input
root = [2, 1, 3]
Ouput
[2, 3, 1]
```

We don't change the `root` node just the left subtree and right subtree of the `root` nodes and child nodes exchanges their positions.

## How do we solve this?

In <b>Python</b> it's very easy to swap two variable. 

In case of swappnig left subtree and right subtree we can just do `root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left` and the subtrees are swapped and we can <b>recursively</b> do this. 

Here, the word <b>recursion</b> is important. When it comes to solving problems/questions related to <i>trees</i> we mostly will use <b>recursion</b>. 

Recursion is very sneaky and hard to comprehend but it comes with practice.

Let's assume we are given the below tree to invert.

We have a hypothetical function called `invertTree()` which takes the root node and inverts the tree.

We start with the root node and it will recursively keep on 
moving to the left and right subtrees and their left and right children. Let's see here;

The left and right subtrees will change as follows

As we move above the left subtree will be entirely replaces by the right subtree will be replaced by the leftsubtree like this.

Like this we will have inverted our binary tree.

## Let's code it out

```dart:invert_binary_tree.py

def invertTree(root):

    if root:

        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left

        if root.left:
            invertTree(root.left)
        if root.right:
            invertTree(root.right)
        

        return root
    
    else:

        return None
```

And we are done. Just 10 to 11 lines of code.
