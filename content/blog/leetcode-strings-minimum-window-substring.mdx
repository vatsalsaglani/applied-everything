## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum
  window in s which will contain all the characters in t. If there is no such
  window in s that covers all characters in t, return the empty string "".
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example

Input
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"

Output: "BANC"

```

## How do we solve this?

Like every other string and substring question this question also will be solved using a sliding window approach and anyone can guess it, it's given in the title itself.

So how do we apply a sliding window technique to this question.

Let's talk about all our initial variables first. We will have a `res` and `resLen` variable. 
The `res` variable will be a `list` which will store the start and end index of the substring of minimum length.
`resLen` will store the lenght of the substring in `res`.

Given the target `t` we will count the number of characters in string `t` and store it as a dictionary under variable `countT`.

Similarly, while looping over the string we will have one more dictionary variable to store the occurrences of strings travelled in the loop which will be `window`.

We will have two more variable `have` and `need`. 
`have` will store how many characters do we have in our window which are required to form the target `t`. 
`need` is the number of characters in target or simply the length of `countT`.

We will loop over the given string and starting add all the occurrences of a character to the window variable until we have `have == need`. Once we get `have == need` we can start shrinking the window from the left.

When `have == need` condition is satisfied we update our `res` and `resLen` variables with the appropriate values.

While shrinking the window from the left if we remove any character which is required to form the target string `t` and `window[character] < countT[character]`, we would need to continue the upper for loop till `have == need`. We continue this till we loop to the end of the string.

## Let's code it out

```dart:min_window.py

def minWindow(s, t):

    if t == "": return ""

    countT, window = {}, {}

    for c in t:
        countT[c] = 1 + countT.get(c, 0)
    
    have, need = 0, len(countT)

    res, resLen = [-1, -1], float("infinity")

    left = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):

        current = s[right]

        # update occurrence of current character in window dictionary

        window[current] = 1 + window.get(current, 0)

        if current in countT and countT[current] == window[current]:
            have += 1
        
        while have == need:

            if (right - left + 1) < resLen:

                res = [left, right]
                resLen = right - left + 1
            
            ## shrink window from left`

            window[s[left]] -= 1

            if s[left] in countT and window[s[left]] < countT[s[left]]:

                have -= 1
            
            left += 1
        
    left, right = res

    return s[left:right+1] if not resLen == float("infinity") else ""

```
