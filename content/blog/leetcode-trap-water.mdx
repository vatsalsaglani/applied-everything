## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of
  each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
</blockquote>

## How do we solve this problem?

This problem is faily similar to the <a target="_blank" href = "/blog/leetcode-arrays-max-container">Max Container</a> problem. Instead of finding the area between two poles of different heights we are counting how many **1-unit** water blocks can be formed when rain water is trapped between poles of different heights.

_Let's look at an example_

<blockquote>
  We are given an heights list [4, 2, 3] and we need to find how many 1 - unit
  water blocks we can fit with this formation.
</blockquote>

Here we can see that we can trap only **one** 1-unit water block between heights 4 and 3. If we trap water to match the height of the highest pole than the water will splill from the minimum side. So we will end up only trapping water till the level of the minimum height elevation.

And from the above image we can also see that if instead of the elevation with height **3** at the end if that height was **1** or even **2** then we couldn't have trapped any amount of water. So now we can deduce that to store the maximum amount of water we want the start height and the end height to be near maximum and the heights in between them must be smaller than the heights of start and end.

Using this visualization let's try to solve this problem.

*We will initialize a few variables - `left_ptr` (at the start), `right_ptr` (at the end), `max_water` (`0` to keep count of 1-unit water blocks which can be trapped), `max_left` (maximum height at start to update `left_ptr`), and `max_right` (maximum height at end to update the `right_ptr`)*

*Now, after initializing we check if the `max_left < max_right` we move the `left_ptr` by `1` and then we update the `max_left` with `max(max_left, height[new_left_ptr])` and add to our `max_water` variable if water can be trapped with formula `max_left - height[new_left_ptr]`*

*Similarly, we do this for the `right_ptr` by checking the `else` condition i.e. `max_left >= max_right`. We continue this till we have `left_ptr < right_ptr`.*

**Note: Here, the `new_left_ptr` just represents `left_ptr` after `left_ptr += 1`**

### Let's see it in code

```dart:trapwater.py
def maxTrapWater(height):

    left_ptr = 0
    right_ptr = len(height) - 1

    max_left = height[left_ptr]
    max_right = height[right_ptr]

    max_water = 0

    while left_ptr < right_ptr:


        if max_left < max_right:

            left_ptr += 1
            max_left = max(max_left, height[left_ptr])
            max_water += max_left - height[left_ptr]
        
        else:

            right_ptr -= 1
            max_right = max(max_right, height[right_ptr])
            max_water += max_right - height[right_ptr]
        

        
    return max_water

```

<blockquote>
    Let's do one iteration for the list of elevations [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]
</blockquote>

#### Iteration - 1

```dart:iteration_1
# start
max_left = 4
max_right = 5
left_ptr = 0
right_ptr = 5
max_water = 0 (max_area)
```

*Let's do things step-by-step,*

ðŸ”µ Step - 1: Check `max_left` and `max_right` and move `left_ptr` or `right_ptr` accordingly

*Here, `max_left` is lesser than `max_right` so we move the `left_ptr` by `1` and our new `left_ptr` will be `1`.*

ðŸ”µ Step - 2: Change `max_left` using the new `left_ptr`

*Now, `left_ptr` is equal to `1`, so let's change the `max_left`*

```dart:max_left_change
## formula is 
max_left = max(max_left, height[left_ptr])
## therefore;
max_left = max(4, 2)
## therefore;
max_left = 4
```

*As the height at the new `left_ptr` i.e. index `1` is **2** and our previous `max_left` was **4** we check the maximum between them is **4** so we change the `max_left` to **4** and in hindsight it would have remained the same.*

ðŸ”µ Step - 3: Update the `max_water` or `max_area` variable

*After we change the `max_left` we need to add how many 1-unit block can be trapped when we transition the `left_ptr` by `1`.*

```dart:update_max_water
## formulat
max_water = max_water + (max_left - height[left_ptr])
## or simply
max_water += max_left - height[left_ptr]
## therefore;
max_water = 0 + (4 - 2)
## therefore;
max_water = 2
```

These **three steps** can be applied for the `right_ptr` as well when `max_right` is less than or equal to `max_left`. Instead of increasing the `right_ptr` by `1` we just decrease it by `1` and update the `max_right` and the `max_water` which can be trapped on transition from `right_ptr` to `right_ptr - 1`.

So for this example after the first iteration the variables initialized will we updated and the values will look something like below.

```dart:iteration_1
#end
left_ptr = 1
right_ptr = 5
max_left = 4
max_right = 5
max_water = 2 (max_area)
```

<blockquote>
    Now let's make an assumption in the above example. Let's assume if after 4 (max_left) the height would be 5 instead of 2 then how would have things changed or variables changed
</blockquote>

*As assumed, the first step will be same becuase the initialized `max_left` is lesser than the initialized `max_right` so we will move the `left_ptr` by `1`.*  

*Now, our `max_left` would be changed to `5` because the maximum between `max_left (4)` and height at current `left_ptr` i.e. `5` is `5`.*

*And when we update `max_water` we will see that it will be `max_left (5) - height[left_ptr] (5)` is `0`. So the `max_water` will still remain `0`. Here, we can also notice that as the `max_water` didn't change from transition of `left_ptr` we can neglect the start `left_ptr` or height at start `left_ptr` i.e. at index `0` and move on.*
