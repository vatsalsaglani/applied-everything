## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the
  reversed list.
</blockquote>

### Let's look at an example

```dart:example
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

## How do we solve this?

Before we begin with this problem related to linked lists if you haven't checked out my short theoritical blog on linked list check it out <a target="_blank" href="/blog/leetcode-linkedlists-about-linked-lists">here</a>.

Moving on, we know that the pointer in the node refers provides a reference to the `next` node. So we can just change the pointer direction and our list will be reversed.

Let's see what happens when we change the pointer directions.

### So, how do we reverse the pointer references?

It's easy we will initialize a variable `prev` with value `None` and start at the `head`, copy it into a temporary variable `temp` and set the `next` of `temp` i.e. `temp.next` to `prev` (at start the value of `prev` will be `None`) and set the `prev` variable to `temp` variable.

I know it's two much in one paragraph so let's look it in some figures.

_I know my handwriting isn't that good, so no comments please_ ðŸ˜…

#### Initial Stage

```dart:variables
prev = None
```

#### Iteration 1

```dart:iteration1
# using temporary variable to store current head
temp = head
# moving head to next node i.e. Node with value 2
head = head.next
# Node with value 1 points to prev i.e. None
temp.next = prev
# prev travels to temp i.e. Node with value 1
prev = temp
```

#### Iteration 2

```dart:iteration2
# using temporary variable to store current head
temp = head
# moving head to next node i.e. Node with value 3
head = head.next
# Node with value 2 points to prev i.e. Node with value 1
temp.next = prev
# prev travels to temp i.e. Node with value 2
prev = temp
```

#### Iteration 4

```dart:iteration2
# using temporary variable to store current head
temp = head
# moving head to next node i.e. Node with value Node
# nothing after 3 therefore None and loop will end after this
head = head.next
# Node with value 3 points to prev i.e. Node with value 2
temp.next = prev
# prev travels to temp i.e. Node with value 3
prev = temp
```

From this you can see that as we reverse the links/pointer references the entire linked list gets reversed

### Let's code it out

```dart:reverse_linked_list.py

def reverseLinkedList(head):

    prev = None

    while head:

        temp = head

        head = head.next

        temp.next = prev

        prev = temp

    return prev
```

We return `prev` because once we reach the end while traveling from the end node and we reverse every pointer reference the last node will become our head node. So now `prev` will be at node with value `3` and it will become our head and we can return that.
