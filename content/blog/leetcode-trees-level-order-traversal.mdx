## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its
  nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
</blockquote>

### Let's see an example

```dart:example
Input:
root = [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]
Output:
[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]
```

## How do we solve this?

A level order traversal in tree is similar to BFS in graphs. 

We start at the root node and check it's left and right nodes. Add to the queue and then pop from the queue and get a node get it's left and right add to the queue and again pop from the queue and continue to do the same until the queue is empty.

Let's do this process on an example

## Let's code it out

```dart:level_order_tree.py

def levelOrder(root):

    if not root:
        return []
    
    traversal = []
    queue = []
    queue.append(root)

    while queue:

        lenloop = len(queue)
        level = []

        for i in range(lenloop):

            node =queue.pop(0)

            if node:
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
                level.append(node.val)
            
        if level:
            traversal.append(level)
    
    return traversal

```
